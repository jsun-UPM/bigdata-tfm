        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",

It has population of over 54 million living across seven States and Seven Regions plus Union Territory, where all central government departments are located. On 1 February 2021, following the Myanmar Military took over a state of emergency was declared. Following the takeover, the security situation in the country worsened, leading to a “Level 2” emergency designation and in keeping with the relevant protocols triggering the activation of cluster system to respond to the worsening humanitarian situation.  Increased security measures due to the deteriorating security situation, has led to many-fold increase in internally displaced persons (IDP) to more than 1,703,900 from 328,000 before February 2021.\n\nThe country has since experienced a protracted humanitarian situation characterised by sub-optimal access to health services, increasing malnutrition due to deteriorating food security situation and worsening protection risks including risks to mine and other explosive remnants of war injuries. Apart from this, education services access has deteriorated, and the COVID-19 pandemic induced restrictions led to an almost continuous nationwide school closure from March 2020. The closures left over 12 million school aged children in Myanmar with limited access to materials for their learning and overall well-being, including education, mental health and psycho-social support and Covid-19 prevention materials. Following the military takeover in February 2021 the humanitarian crisis further worsened, and other dynamics such as an increasingly difficult economic situation continue, high inflation leading to reduced purchasing power of the local currency and access to markets. Generally, this disproportionately affected children and other vulnerable persons’ access to health, nutritious foods, protection, and education services. In this context, the humanitarian wide support needs to be strengthened and this includes information management functions to monitor the situation, evaluate response progress as per the humanitarian response plans targets and activities, promote advocacy and evidence-based program response.",

The IPRCC is designed to provide a platform for knowledge sharing, information exchange and international collaboration in the areas of poverty reduction and development. The International Poverty Reduction Center in China aims at strengthening national and international capacities to design and implement policies and programs for poverty reduction, with a focus on both income and human dimensions of poverty, through (i) providing an effective platform for knowledge sharing and mutual learning on pro-poor policies and anti-poverty programs between China and other developing/transition economies (ii) supporting a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction through policy-relevant research work and training initiatives covering both macro-policies and targeted programs for poverty reduction (iii) promoting dialogue between policymakers, academics and practitioners around pro-poor policy options and strengthening the links between pro-poor policy research, formulation and implementation processes at different levels. IPRCC will also build up its institutional capacity to develop a global poverty reduction and development partnership ,through active networking and partnering for knowledge exchange, joint research and training initiatives with poverty reduction focused institutions in China and other countries.\n\nBrief Portfolio Description:\nGlobally, an estimated 131 million people fell back into poverty in 2020 and up to 800 million people are projected to still remain in poverty in 2030 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises – thereby missing the zero poverty goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In line with the UNDP Country Programme Document for China 2021-2025, this project “Building a Global Poverty Reduction and Rural Development Partnership towards Global Poverty Eradication”  aims to support the International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC) in scaling up the dissemination of policies, strategies and practices that were developed by China to achieve its goal of ending extreme rural poverty in the country by 2020 with interested partners. The project will support the IPRCC to bolster its institutional capacity to address global challenges through research, pilot demonstration, international exchanges, and capacity building activities, with a focus on women and other vulnerable groups. By supporting the IPRCC in developing a global poverty reduction and development partnership, the project will enhance the Center’s contribution to global progress on sustainable development, and in particular towards SDG1 (No Poverty) and SDG5 (Gender Equality). \n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",

The CP Programme seeks to improve and expand services to children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with the law under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act and related legislation with regard to child trafficking, child labour, child marriage and the sexual abuse of children.

        "context": "Since 1964, child rights have been at the heart of the strong partnership between the Government of Malaysia and UNICEF. UNICEF’s work in Malaysia is driven by the ultimate aim of ensuring that every child, especially the most vulnerable, has a fair, equitable start in life. This means that all girls and boys regardless of location, family income or disability  ought to enjoy equal access to quality services and an equal chance of developing to their full potential. \n\nAn upper middle income and culturally diverse country, Malaysia is home to 32.7 million people of which 9.2 million are children. The country has witnessed tremendous progress over the years in poverty reduction, access to primary health care, education, and advances in Child Rights and wellbeing, social and cultural norms. However, gaps in the legal, regulatory and policy framework, comparatively low levels of public expenditure on social protection and social services, and limited capacity in the public sector to meet the demands of the equity agenda, constrain women and child rights.  Further advances in education, health and nutrition, and social protection outcomes are needed if Malaysia is to achieve advanced nation status. \n\nUNICEF Malaysia is a unique country office in that it is an upper middle-income country, but with significant remaining disparities and inequalities where both advocacy and programming approaches are required. UNICEF adds value by influencing the development narrative of the country through quality evidence generation, evidence-based advocacy and policy recommendations, supported by partnerships and alliances with civil society, academia, and think tanks. UNICEF Malaysia also has a highly developed Private Sector Fundraising Team (PSFR) which raises significant resources for children in innovative ways. In this context, the role of multi-faceted evidence-based communications and policy advocacy and partnership building play critical roles in advancing child rights.\n\nAdopting a human rights-based approach, the UNICEF country programme in Malaysia has been designed in partnership with the Government of Malaysia and is aligned with the Shared Prosperity Vision for 2030 and the 12th Malaysia Plan. The programme responds directly to UNICEF’s and the UN’s global priorities, Agenda 2030, the Leaving No One Behind and Build Back Better agendas and forms an integral part of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for Malaysia 2021-2025.\n",

In addition, while the State has been proficient at documenting success stories, policies, and guidelines, there is a noticeable gap in demonstrating how processes have been put in place, i.e., process documentation is often lacking. There would be greater potential for advocacy and publicity at the national level for SDG-aligned priorities, such as partnership building, sustainable development, etc. \n\nOdisha has experienced a nearly seven-fold increase in extreme flood events, affecting over 12.6 million people annually, especially in districts like Cuttack, Gajapati, Jajpur, Khurda, and Rayagada. There has been a four-fold increase in droughts in the last ten years, with extreme drought hotspots including Angul, Gajapati, Kandhamal, and Sundergarh. Odisha has faced contrasting extreme weather conditions, from heat waves to cyclones and from droughts to floods, which have become more frequent and have hit areas previously not considered vulnerable. Agriculture, a vital sector for the state’s economy, is the worst affected due to changes in micro-climate and natural calamities.\nThe state has built shelter homes capable of withstanding high-velocity winds, and there is a need to climate-proof other critical infrastructure to ensure faster recovery and protect citizens.",
        "context": "Government of Odisha is implementing the WASH related programs of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) / BASUDHA and Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). SBM has been implemented as a nationwide campaign of the Govt. of India (GoI) to eliminate open defecation through mass-scale behaviour change, construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets, and by establishing an accountability mechanism for monitoring toilet use.  Having achieved the outcomes of ODF, in SBM Phase II was launched and now focuses on sustaining ODF behaviors and solid and liquid waste management. These activities will be monitored based on output-outcome indicators such as the number of villages covered with solid waste management, the number of villages incorporating grey water management, the number of blocks having a Plastic Waste Management Unit, the number of districts covered with Faecal Sludge Management (FSM), the number of IHHLs (Individual Household Latrine) built etc. \nJal Jeevan Mission (JJM) was launched by the Min. of Jal Shakti in partnership with states, to enable every household in villages to have a Functional Household Tap Connection. Odisha has planned to provide 70 litres per capita per day to all HHs, institutions, and public places specified scheme named BASUDHA. It is envisaged that with FHTC, each household will have a potable water supply in an adequate quantity of prescribed quality on a regular and long-term basis. \n\nUNICEF is supporting the GOI policy in Odisha by implementing key policies through the Swachh Bharat Swachh Vidyalaya (SBSV), a complementary initiative promoting access to functional toilets and hygiene practices for boys and girls in all schools. In addition to SBSV, UNICEF's support for WASH in institutions will extend to community centres that double as preschool areas, called Anganwadis, and will aim to cover nutrition and WASH interventions targeting mothers and young children. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has recently reprioritized the provision and use of safely managed drinking water in rural areas. This prioritization, in turn, requires the revision of national guidelines on rural drinking water security and safety. In addition, to the continuous programming work plans, COVID-19 has introduced new challenges and opportunities for the WASH program to expand its purview and help state and national governments prioritize WASH-relevant practices and interventions that mitigate the risk of spreading the illness further. This additional emergency response has become a priority, and while many less urgent programming efforts have been deprioritized, it still has manifested a surplus of communication, guidance, and training material.\nThe Govt of Odisha is committed to combat climate change and promote environmental sustainability. Climate change is also a focus of UNICEF’s support in Odisha through the Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability (CCES) component of the programme. Odisha is one of the first states in India to recognize the vulnerability of its people to climate change and has developed a sector-wise action plan to address its impacts. The state has prepared a comprehensive Odisha Climate Change Action Plan (OCCAP), which outlines strategies across various sectors such as agriculture, energy, fisheries, forests, health, and water resources. A significant initiative is the Climate Budget, where Odisha presented a climate budget to assess and allocate funds for climate change-related activities.\n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.\n\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) works towards the realization of the rights of children as mandated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). These rights pertain to survival, protection, development and participation of children. UNICEF partners with the Government of India and key stakeholders to strengthen policy, programmes, partnerships, commitment and capacity for ensuring better results for children, especially the most marginalized, in line with the country’s vision, the CRC and Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe Communication, Advocacy & Partnership (CAP) section at the UNICEF New Delhi Office aims to drive change for every child, and achieve its strategic goals, by being:\nLeading voice for every child: UNICEF’s media coverage and content reach out to target audiences and connect with them on the importance of children’s rights and challenges in achieving them. Build greater awareness and knowledge, leading to increased reach and engagement.\n\nLeading advocate for every child: UNICEF’s media, celebrity and youth/children’s voices, engagement and platforms are more strategic, evidence-based and further advocacy goals. Build capacity of media as strategic advocates. Celebrity influencers support advocacy goals. Youth and children’s voices and engagement mobilized through media and youth coalitions/networks.\n\nLeading brand for every child: Increasing awareness of UNICEF as the leading organization for children through wider media and celebrity engagement\n\nEngage 100 million individuals for the cause of every child: Contribute to engagement of influencers and wider public across a range of media channels and platforms – traditional, digital and mobile. Invest in communication skills of adolescents and young people for storytelling narratives that appeal to young people. Amplify their voices, ideas and actions.\n\nThis UNV assignment is part of UNICEF’s Communication Advocacy and Partnerships programme. The Communication, Advocacy & Partnership (CAP) section at the UNICEF New Delhi Office aims to drive change for every child, and achieve its strategic goals.\n",
        "context": "The CAP section is seen as a critical driver for upstream advocacy, through strategic partnerships and communication, which contributes to building an enabling environment for accelerating policy shifts, public support, resources and action for achievement of priority goals for children. It engages with stakeholders (including the government, celebrities, civil society, legislators, private sector, media, academia, children, adolescents, and youth), to put children’s rights and well-being at the centre of political, social and economic agenda.\n\nCAP section works collaboratively with all sectors within UNICEF, supporting communication requirements and furthering advocacy objectives – with an overarching focus on child rights, adolescent empowerment, social inclusion, gender and equity.\n\nCAP leads and supports UNICEF’s own national and global advocacy communication priorities and campaigns that are convergent in nature such as Early Childhood Development (ECD), Adolescent Development and Engagement (ADE), global and India specific advocacy priorities (foundational learning, mental health and well-being, immunization, Child Rights, ending violence against women and children) as well as mainstreaming equity, gender-transformative approach and risk informed programming in terms of disaster risk resilience.\n\nCAP’s work also focuses on enhancing visibility and awareness about UNICEF’s role, mandate and brand promotion, for UNICEF’s own flagship campaigns (viz. World Children’s Day, State of World Children’s report), as aligned to global/national advocacy and communication strategy. India’s media industry has grown exponentially in terms of reach, influence and adoption of new technologies, opening new avenues for reaching out to wider audiences as well as segment specific audiences.\n\nTo support in strengthening and positioning UNICEF’s voice as leading advocate on issues concerning rights of children in India with aim of shifting advocacy narrative, focusing on policy, influencing positive behaviours.\n\n\n•\tIncrease visibility of UNICEF India’s work on the ground\n•\tStrengthen trust on UNICEF, as a credible organization \n•\tStrengthen UNICEF’s agility to respond to critical developments that build its voice and trust\n\nCAP aims to achieve this through several strategies. Sustained media engagement, media partnerships and media, capacity development as well as influencer engagement are some of the strategies employed for the above.\n\nTo achieve the above, strategically, with agility and sustained engagement that strengthens UNICEF’s voice and brand, the CAP section requires an experienced UNV with excellent writing, coordination skills, who can support with implementation of media advocacy communication initiatives through media, campaigns and partnerships; influencer engagement, drafting key messages, evidence-based communication assets and packages to support development of content, material for communicating and advocating with media, key influencers, government and public at large. This will adhere with UNICEF’s vision and key priorities for children as well as support the programme sectors and relevant departments to achieve results for children.\n\n",

Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.\n\nIn all of its work, UNICEF takes a life-cycle based approach, recognizing the particular importance of early childhood development and adolescence. UNICEF programmes focus on the most disadvantaged children, including those living in fragile contexts, those with disabilities, those who are affected by rapid urbanization and those affected by environmental degradation.\n\nUNICEF was created with a distinct purpose in mind: to work with others to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child’s path. We advocate for measures to give children the best start in life, because proper care at the youngest age forms the strongest foundation for a person’s future.\n\nWe promote girls’ education – ensuring that they complete primary education as a minimum – because it benefits all children, both girls and boys. Girls who are educated grow up to become better thinkers, better citizens, and better parents to their own children. We act so that all children are immunized against common childhood diseases, and are well nourished: no child should suffer or die from a preventable illness. We work to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among young people because it is right to keep them from harm and enable them to protect others.

        "organization_mission": "UNICEF works to help the children of Indonesia reach their full potential. We assist our partners to monitor and measure progress against these rights via the child-focused Sustainable Development Goals, with an emphasis on the most vulnerable children. Our programme interventions are rights-based, cut across different sectors, respond to the specific needs of girls and boys and address the vulnerabilities and strengths of children in their first and second decades of life.\n\nUNICEF has a strong on-the-ground presence in Indonesia, with seven regional and sub-regional offices. These are primarily in areas with the greatest disparities and service gaps. They complement our high-level policy and programme advice with practical support for planning, financing and service delivery, especially to advocate for quality, equity and sustainability.\n\nIndonesia has the world’s fourth largest child population. UNICEF's presence in the country means we have the potential to impact more than 80 million children. We take this responsibility seriously and are committed to ensuring that children and adolescents – the building blocks of Indonesia’s future – have an equal chance in life.",
        "context": "Indonesia has 65 million young people (out of 264 million population, or 28%) aged 10 to 24 years, including 46 million (18%) adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. This high proportion of young people – often called the “demographic dividend”- are key to Indonesia achieving the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs). According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the State, as the ultimate duty-bearer, has obligations to create an enabling environment that allows the views of children, adolescents and youth to be heard on practices and policies that directly or indirectly concern them. This is why a crucial part of UNICEF’s mandate is to provide young people with opportunities and platforms through which adolescents and youth can build skills, identify their priorities, communicate in their own way and learn from their peers so they are better equipped to take an active role in society. UNICEF Indonesia's strategy for engagement with young people seeks to ensure that they are able to drive positive change – social, economic, political – in their societies. To do that, UNICEF supports an engagement model that promotes active citizenship by supporting adolescents and youth to act on issues that matter for their future. In doing so UNICEF supports many platforms for example, U-Report, Child Forum and the youth network “Mitra Muda”.\n\nWorking with adolescents and young people is intrinsically linked with gender equality work. UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan along with the Adolescent Girls Strategy, places adolescent girls’ well-being and leadership at the centre of its work. Adolescence marks the onset of puberty and a critical transition for cognitive development as well as the start of experimentation with new ways of behaving. It also marks transitioning into a time of risk-taking as well as taking on greater responsibilities. Moreover, it is during adolescence that gender norms are established, transformed or rejected. The second decade of life is also when inequities become more evident. For example, adolescent girls from poor families are particularly at risk of child marriage, which affects 1 in 9 girls across the country. Girls may also risk missing school as they begin menstruation and become victims of bullying. Boys are also impacted by bullying and are especially at risk of physical attacks in schools (32%). Many adolescents have a limited understanding about their reproductive health and HIV/AIDS and this puts them at high risk of having unwanted pregnancies, or contracting Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Finally, although literacy rates are high, adolescents in secondary school are still at risk of dropping out of school because of financial issues, pregnancy or marriage. At the heart of these challenges, lies deep-rooted gendered social norms. \n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",

UNICEF is committed to deliver for all children and young people through its overall impact goal of ‘realizing the rights of every child, especially the most disadvantaged.\n\nBuilding on the current work with, and for, adolescents, in line with the United Nations Youth Strategy, UNICEF is developing a new global partnership, Generation Unlimited (GenU), which is dedicated to expanding opportunities for young people from ages 10 to 24 years. Maximizing the potential of the United Nations system, Governments, Civil Society Organizations and the private sector, and young people themselves, GenU is focused on finding new ways to ensure that every young person is in school, undergoing formal or informal learning or training, or is employed by 2030. The focus will be on reaching those in the greatest danger of being left behind: including girls, the poor, young people with disabilities or on the move, or affected by conflict and natural disasters.\n\nThe India version of GenU has been named YuWaah. It signifies catalytic partnerships to unleash the potential of adolescents and young people. YuWaah has been designed to allow co-creation of solutions that are relevant and scalable for ensuring that young people in India have opportunity and choices for learning; have avenues and spaces for functional and vocational training, and can choose between employment and entrepreneurship which are accessible locally.\n\nOut of the three thematic pillars under GenU/YuWaah, Pillar 1 involves aspirational economic opportunities for young people. This pillar specifically involves: \n•\tBuilding hyper-local job connects \n•\tPromoting apprenticeships \n•\tEnabling ecosystem for youth entrepreneurship.\n\nThe UN Volunteer will be placed with UNICEF in Delhi. The UNV will support GenU/Yuwaah related planning, communication with key partners (including the Government of India, other UN agencies, private sector representatives and young people) and knowledge management. Furthermore, she/he will provide support to initiatives under the thematic area of “Economic opportunity for young people – jobs, apprenticeship and entrepreneurship”.

        "organization_mission": "UNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of children’s rights, to help meet their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential.  UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and strives to establish children’s rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behaviour towards children.  UNICEF insists that the survival, protection and development of children are universal development imperatives that are integral to human progress.\n\nUNICEF and China have a long history of collaboration.  In 1947, China became the first country in Asia to welcome a partnership with UNICEF, and our first programme provided emergency relief services to children.  Between 1948 and 1951, our work in China included child feeding, as well as training to build capacity for maternal and child health care, sanitation and first aid.  This training programme later influenced China's “barefoot doctor” rural healthcare system.  Our partnerships in China resumed in 1979.  Since that time, we have contributed to many of China's most significant developments for children.\n",
        "context": "For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF believes that all children have a right to survive, thrive and fulfil their potential – to the benefit of a better world. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments.\n\nUNICEF China CO is a large country office. While demonstrating results for children at scale in China, we also promote policies and laws and support Government in implementing programmes that contribute to the realization of the rights of all children.  We have about 100 staff members. We work with the Government of China and other partners to ensure that the benefits of the country's development reach the most vulnerable and marginalized children. We share lessons from other countries with China and we share what we learn with others. The Communication Section has 12 team members responsible for communications strategy development, press relations, multimedia, digital, celebrity relations, social behaviour change. The UNV will work to support both multimedia and digital workstreams.\n",

In the true spirit of national ownership, all of UNDP’s assistance in Indonesia is implemented by national entities, including line ministries and the Ministry of National Planning and Development, and at the subnational level by line departments, provincial and district authorities as well as community groups.\n\nWhile each programme supported by UNDP has specific and varied objectives, capacity development is one aim that all UNDP programmes – in Indonesia and worldwide – have in common. This takes on many forms including institutional reform, leadership development, education, and training for members of the public such as journalists, and women’s communities.

Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.\n\nIn all of its work, UNICEF takes a life-cycle based approach, recognizing the particular importance of early childhood development and adolescence. UNICEF programmes focus on the most disadvantaged children, including those living in fragile contexts, those with disabilities, those who are affected by rapid urbanization and those affected by environmental degradation.\n\nUNICEF was created with a distinct purpose in mind: to work with others to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child’s path. We advocate for measures to give children the best start in life, because proper care at the youngest age forms the strongest foundation for a person’s future.\n\nWe promote girls’ education – ensuring that they complete primary education as a minimum – because it benefits all children, both girls and boys. Girls who are educated grow up to become better thinkers, better citizens, and better parents to their own children. We act so that all children are immunized against common childhood diseases, and are well nourished: no child should suffer or die from a preventable illness. We work to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among young people because it is right to keep them from harm and enable them to protect others. We help children and families affected by HIV/AIDS to live their lives with dignity.\n\nWe are UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund.",

The programmes and schemes for tribal people are intended to support and supplement the efforts, primarily of other state departments to fill critical gaps within institutions and programmes, taking into account the situation of STs. These schemes comprising of economic, educational, and social development through institutional building, are administered by the line departments. Notwithstanding numerous developmental interventions, the STs continue to face developmental deficits with respect to health, education, livelihood, development infrastructure as well as other socio-economic indices, many of which are well below the national average.\n\nThe Tribal Development Department is committed to providing equitable access to opportunity for the tribal communities, through participatory approach and adoption of innovative methods including e-governance and increasing use of technology to provide strategic inputs into the development process. To accelerate the implementation of the development agenda for the tribal communities and strengthen the institutional delivery systems at the State and district level, it is important to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of the officials and stakeholders to deliver on the issues related to tribal empowerment and create robust systems for monitoring and implementation of the tribal development schemes of the Central and State government.\n\nThe Department is working in collaboration with UNDP to fast-track development in difficult geographies inhabited by tribal populations, enhancing capacities of government functionaries and expanding opportunities for better livelihoods, health and education to vulnerable tribal communities.  \n\n",

It is equally a key priority for UNDP as emphasized in UNDP’s Strategic Plan 2022-2025 (where UNDP aims to continue work through six signature solutions on poverty and inequality, governance, resilience, environment, energy and gender equality to achieve sustainable development) and the Country Programme of UNDP in Thailand (2022-2026).\n\nThe successful applicant will join a team of dedicated development professionals whose primary role is to support Thailand to achieve the 2030 Agenda. As part of the UNDP team the focus of this position will be to support the project manager in finalizing the project work plan and implementation of project activities in collaboration with project partners and stakeholders at national and local levels. The position will ultimately support the project manager to find specific local solutions contributing to sustainable development and to ensure that no one is left behind through multi-stakeholder engagement and capacity building for achievement of SDGs across Thailand. \n\nUNDP is looking for a candidate with good communication, research, coordination, planning and reporting skills and abilities to help build links, choices and connections across project partners and sectors. We seek an enthusiastic, motivated, and committed person to making a positive contribution to promoting sustainable development in Thailand. \n\nUnder the overall guidance and direct supervision of the Project Manager, the UNV will ensure effective and timely reporting and delivery of the Project titled “Strengthening SDG Localization in Thailand”. The aim of the project is to strengthen dialogue to achieve the SDGs in Thailand at national and local levels, with special attention on human rights, gender equality, environment and resilience to climate change. This will be achieved through two outputs (1) Inclusive participation representing different social groups in SDG localization increased, at local and provincial levels and (2) Capacity building enhanced for state and non-State actors on the SDGs to foster data driven and gender-responsive SDG localization in Thailand. The UNV will play a crucial role in supporting the implementation of this project, with special focus on organization of workshops and trainings, communication of project results, and stakeholder engagement.  \n",

        "living_conditions": "Afghanistan is a hardship duty station with volatile security. Living and working conditions for UN volunteers in UNAMA are similar to the living conditions of all other internationally recruited staff members. UN volunteers are provided with safe accommodation in an extensive compound in Kabul with good infrastructure and amenities. The mission has three compounds in Kabul: Compound Alpha, and UNOCA (UN Operational Complex in Afghanistan) the largest one. UNAMA has three different locations in Kabul, most of the substantive offices, including the SRSG’s are located at the so-called alpha Compound and Palace #7, which is close to the city center, while most of the administrative and technical\nsupport offices are located at the UNOCA compound on Jalalabad Road, at some distance from central Kabul. Generally speaking, stringent security measures are in place throughout the country and UN volunteers as other UN staff, are quite limited to duty stations when it comes to movement. Walking is virtually not allowed. The movement is done inside the “green zone” (only) in armored vehicles driven by national qualified UN drivers. The single unit accommodation in UNOCA and other field locations is fully furnished; this includes, furniture, washing machine dryer, hot plate, iron and iron stand, microwave, plates, cups, spoons, cooking utensils, electric kettle. One bedsheet and pillow cover are provided. The monthly charge for UN-provided accommodation is USD 300 which is deducted from the monthly Volunteer Living Allowance. Inside the UNOCA compound are two cafeterias, a restaurant, a Supermarket, and 3 small shops which provide a variety of imported canned and frozen food on offer. There is a Fresh vegetable market daily. There is also a social center, a gym hall, and a small library with books and DVDs, run by the welfare Office, within the same compound. UNOCA has a new minimarket where basic goods can be bought also. There are also a number of UN-cleared supermarkets in Kabul, in Jalalabad, and in Mazar-I-Sharif. The Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own towel\nand other personal accessories including toiletries and medicines which they may not find easily within the supermarkets inside the UNOCA Compound. Some degree of medical service is provided in all UNAMA duty stations. There is a UN clinic in UNAMA/UNOCA complex and access is granted in Kabul to other private international clinics (when and if needed). Contact with and outreach to the local community is usually limited. As mentioned, many places are off-limits and the choice of recreational facilities is very poor. For all these reasons, bringing a stock of books, DVDs/VCDs, computer games, etc., is highly recommended. Summer in Afghanistan is hot and dry but winter is the opposite –\ncold and wet. Therefore, both summer and winter clothing and comfortable boots with insulation are necessary. Afghanistan is a unique country and UNAMA is a unique UN mission. It requires more stamina, commitment, and flexibility than elsewhere to make life comfortable. Therefore, flexibility and the ability and willingness to live and work in hazardous and harsh conditions involving physical hardship and little comfort is essential. https://www.unv.org/",

        "living_conditions": "Myanmar is a Southeast Asian nation of more than 100 ethnic groups, bordering India, Bangladesh, China, Laos and Thailand. It has a population of over 54 million living across fourteen States and Regions and one Union Territory, the capital Naypyitaw, where all central government departments are located. About 70% of the population lives in rural areas, and the main economy of Myanmar is agriculture. Myanmar is a subtropical and tropical country with three distinct seasons: Summer (from March to June), Rainy (from July to October) and Winter (from November to February).\n\nMost of the population in Myanmar practices Theravada Buddhism. There are also religious minorities, including Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. Burmese is the country's official and most widely spoken language. However, many ethnic communities speak their own languages and dialects.\n\nMyanmar has a complex political history, including British colonial rule and decades of military dictatorship. In 2011, a process of political liberalization and democratic transition began. However, in February 2021, the military staged a coup, taking control of the country again, leading to significant political unrest and protests. Following the takeover, the security situation in the country worsened. Since 30 March 2021, a family restriction has been in place, and eligible family members of international staff members have been evacuated. Civilians, especially governmental staff, joined the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM). Consequently, the provision of almost all public services is affected, especially banking and health care systems. In addition, as numerous anti-coup groups are shifting focus from peaceful demonstrations to armed revolution, Myanmar's security situation is volatile and unpredictable. Acts of violence by both parties of the conflict can occur anywhere, anytime, and a further deterioration of the security situation is possible.\n\nAlmost half of the country’s population is estimated to live in poverty. Humanitarian needs have worsened, and the number of internally displaced people has risen to 1.6 million out of a total population of 56 million, as of September 2023. Following 10/27 armed conflicts led by three brother’s alliance, armed conflicts speedily spread out across the country with rapid increase in internally dis-placed people to 2.2 million as of January 2024 with highest burden in northwest. Despite the country’s dire humanitarian situation, the de facto authorities are limiting the movement of essential goods and humanitarian access throughout many parts of the country. \n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",
        "context": "In recent years, UNICEF’s work to support the unique needs of young people has gained momentum, as the challenges facing them have come more sharply into view. UNICEF is committed to deliver for all children and young people through its overall impact goal of ‘realizing the rights of every child, especially the most disadvantaged. \n \nBuilding on the current work with, and for, adolescents, in line with the United Nations Youth Strategy, UNICEF is developing a new global partnership, Generation Unlimited (GenU), which is dedicated to expanding opportunity for young people from ages 10 to 24 years. Maximising the potential of the United Nations system, Governments, Civil Society Organizations and the private sector, and of young people themselves, GenU is focused on finding new ways to ensure that every young person is in school, undergoing formal or informal learning or training, or is employed by 2030. The focus will be on reaching those in the greatest danger of being left behind: including girls, the poor, young people with disabilities or on the move, or affected by conflict and natural disasters.  \n \nThe India version of GenU has been named YuWaah. It signifies catalytic partnerships to unleash the potential of adolescents and young people. YuWaah has been designed to allow co-creation of solutions that are relevant and scalable for ensuring that young people in India have opportunity and choices for learning; have avenues and spaces for functional and vocational training and can choose between employment and entrepreneurship which are accessible locally.  \n\nOut of the three pillars under GenU/YuWaah, Pillar 3 involves partnering with and engaging young people as changemakers and creating spaces for developing their leadership. This pillar specifically involves:\n\n1.\tYouth-led innovations and fostering the development of design thinking and problem-solving skills in young people \n2.\tFacilitating meaningful civic engagement of young people \n",

        "context": "The Local Climate Adaptive Living (LoCAL) facility of the UNCDF was designed and launched in 2011 with the aim of promoting climate change-resilient communities and local economies by establishing a standard and internationally recognized country-based mechanism to channel climate finance to local government authorities (LGAs) in LDCs and to increase local resilience, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly the specific goals of poverty eradication (SDG1) and climate action (SDG13). LoCAL increases awareness and capacities to respond to climate change at the local level, integrates climate change adaptation into local governments' planning and budgeting systems, in a participatory and gender-sensitive manner, and increases the amount of finance available to local governments for climate change adaptation. \n\nLoCAL focuses on the delivery of four outputs that will directly contribute to increasing local governments’ access to climate finance and building resilience to climate change:\n\n•\tOutput 1 – Awareness and capacities to respond to climate change adaptation at the local level are increased;\n•\tOutput 2 – CCA is mainstreamed into government’s planning and budgeting systems and investments are implemented in line with the PBCRG mechanism;\n•\tOutput 3 – The PBCRG system is effectively and sustainably established in participating countries and leads to an increased amount of CCA finance available to local government and local economy;\n•\tOutput 4 – The role of local authorities and of the PBCRGS in addressing climate change are increasingly recognized at international level, through outreach, learning and quality assurance.\n\nLoCAL combines performance-based climate resilience grants (PBCRGs) with technical and capacity-building support. PBCRGs ensure programming and verification of climate change expenditures at the local level and offer strong incentives for general performance improvements targeting areas of importance for enhanced resilience. The PBCRG can be seen as an earmarked cross-sectoral grant with conditions attached to the use of its funding for climate change adaptation beyond business as usual. Combined with regular grant allocations, PBCRGs enable 100 per cent of the investments in climate-sensitive sectors to become climate resilient over time.\n\nThe PBCRGs consist of a financial top-up to cover the additional costs of making investments climate resilient and/or of additional investments for climate change adaptation. These grants complement regular allocations made by the central level to local governments through the respective intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. They include a set of minimum conditions, performance measures and a menu of eligible investments.\n\nAs part of the LoCAL Team, working under the direct supervision of the Programme Specialist, P3 based in Bangkok, and under the overall leadership of the Global Climate Facility Manager, P5 based in Kampala, the Programme Officer will contribute to the effective delivery and monitoring of the Programme’s activities in target countries, covering all the expected results. It is expected that 25% of the IUNV time will be dedicated to global activities, and 75% on Asia Pacific region. \n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",

UNICEF continue to support the country's transition from decades of war and natural disasters so that children, adolescents and women can access the services they need and fulfil their right to survival, development, protection and participation. \n\nUNICEF works to promote and protect the rights and wellbeing of children and women in Afghanistan.

        "organization_mission": "UNDP believes that the people of Indonesia should have ownership over the programmes and projects we support. All UNDP programmes therefore actively promote the spirit of mutual respect, support and accountability and subscribe to the principle of national ownership as enshrined in the Jakarta Commitment – a declaration put forward by the government and its development partners in 2009 to strengthen aid effectiveness in Indonesia. In the true spirit of national ownership, all of UNDP’s assistance in Indonesia is implemented by national entities, including line ministries and the Ministry of National Planning and Development, and at the subnational level by line departments, provincial and district authorities as well as community groups.\n\nWhile each programme supported by UNDP has specific and varied objectives, capacity development is one aim that all UNDP programmes – in Indonesia and worldwide – have in common. This takes on many forms including institutional reform, leadership development, education, and training for members of the public such as journalists, and women’s communities. In line with this logic, UNDP advisers work side by side with Indonesian counterparts to strengthen capacities in technical matters, policy formulation and budget planning, amongst others.",
        "context": "The Water-Energy-Food Nexus is at the heart of sustainable development (UN Water, 2023) . It is a conceptual framework that recognizes the intricate and interdependent relationship between water, energy, and food systems (FAO, 2014 , Daher, B., et al, 2021 ). At its essence, this concept emphasizes that actions in one sector can have cascading effects on the others. It seeks to address the complex challenges arising from the interconnected nature of water, energy, and food resources. Understanding and managing this nexus is crucial for achieving sustainable development and ensuring resilience in the face of evolving global dynamics.\n\nWater is essential for agricultural irrigation and energy production, energy is required for water extraction, treatment, and transportation, while food production demands both water and energy inputs. 72% of all freshwater withdrawals are used by agriculture, 16% by industries, and 12% by municipalities, and therefore, rising water stress is affecting food security and biodiversity (UN Water, 2023). The food production and supply chain accounts for about 30% of total global energy consumption (FAO, 2011) , while 90% of global power generation is water-intensive, where power plant cooling is responsible for 43% of total freshwater withdrawals in Europe (more than 50% in several countries) (UN, 2014) .\n\nThis interdependence creates a delicate balance where decisions and policies affecting one sector inevitably impact the others. Striking an equilibrium in managing these resources is vital to ensure the sustainability and security of water, energy, and food systems on a local and global scale.\n\nUNDP Indonesia, in collaboration with BAPPENAS will study the intricate Nexus of these important resources, and will explore the importance of Policy and governance, Technologies and Finance in propelling the Nexus thinking forward. Dynamic interaction between the three resources, and how to measure the Nexus will also be part of this initiative. \n\nThis UNV assignment is part of Program Integration and Development Analyses Team, UNDP Indonesia. The Policy and Innovation Specialist: Nexus of Water Energy and Food will be report to Senior Advisor of Program Integration and Development Analyses, and work of team of consultants, and partners.",

Most of the serious cases have been reported contracted in hilly, rural and densely forested areas. City dwellers like in Phnom Penh can also be at risk due to poor disposal of waste. Generally, in cities, people use purified water for drinking and cooking. The recommended vaccinations are those against typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Tuberculosis and Japanese Encephalitis. While medical facilities in Cambodia are sufficient for the treatment of most routine ailments and minor accidents, illnesses and accidents of more serious nature require medical evacuation, usually to Bangkok or Singapore.

UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and strives to establish children’s rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behaviour towards children.  UNICEF insists that the survival, protection and development of children are universal development imperatives that are integral to human progress.\n\nUNICEF and China have a long history of collaboration.  In 1947, China became the first country in Asia to welcome a partnership with UNICEF, and our first programme provided emergency relief services to children.  Between 1948 and 1951, our work in China included child feeding, as well as training to build capacity for maternal and child health care, sanitation and first aid.  This training programme later influenced China's “barefoot doctor” rural healthcare system.  Our partnerships in China resumed in 1979.  Since that time, we have contributed to many of China's most significant developments for children.\n",
        "context": "UNICEF China and its government partners work to improve the lives of the most vulnerable children. Every child has the right to survive, develop, be protected and participate in family and society. UNICEF collaborates with many partners to help make those rights a reality in China. We work by developing demonstration models and approaches in rural poor and urban marginalized communities. Once an approach has been shown to be effective, we support the government to replicate and expand the approach with its own budget.\n\nUNICEF also plays an important role in advancing research and assembling scientific evidence about children in collaboration with Chinese universities, research centres and policy-making institutions. We support the government to use this data, along with the findings from our pilot programmes, to develop evidence-based policies and laws.\n\nIn the recent past, many important achievements for children in China have been based on innovative models and pioneering research supported by UNICEF.  For more than forty years, our programme of cooperation with the Government of China has helped to improve the lives of children and women in all provinces.\n\nUNICEF also partners with the private sector by providing ideas and opportunities for improving the lives of children in China. Children's rights and welfare are integral to a corporation's social responsibility to the communities in which it works.  We are helping the private sector to develop child's rights business principles, engage on protecting child rights, and mobilize to make children's lives better.\n\nAs a global child rights organization, UNICEF also helps to give a voice to and advocate for children, so that their rights are given the highest priority by all sectors of society. As China's development moves ahead rapidly we are increasingly focused on engaging all citizens in China in the mission of promoting and protecting children's rights.\n\nAt UNICEF, we commit to the highest levels of integrity, transparency and accountability in our procurement activities, and we work with suppliers that comply with the highest ethical standards of conduct. \n\nUNICEF Supply Division has identified 8 strategic areas (listed below) to drive equitable access to essential supplies and services for every child and adolescent during the 2022-2025 period.\n\n1.\tEmergency preparedness and response  \n2.\tStrategic procurement and delivery  \n3.\tMarket influencing and product innovation\n4.\tFinancing partnerships and solutions  \n5.\tSystems strengthening \n6.\tDigitalization of the supply chain\n7.\tStrategic partnerships \n8.\tPeople and culture \n\nAnd the future and present of the public procurement for UNICEF is in sustainable procurement\n\n",

        "organization_mission": "UNDP has been working across Afghanistan for more than 50 years on challenges related to climate change and resilience, gender, governance, health, livelihoods and rule of law.\n\nGuided by the government and its Development Councils, our work is fully aligned with the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework and National Priority Programmes, and is carried out in close coordination with partner UN agencies under the One UN Framework.\n\nAs the UN’s development network, we connect the Afghan government and people with the resources and information they need to drive their own development according to their own priorities, as well as to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.",
        "context": "UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations build integrated, lasting solutions for people and the planet. UNDP has been working in Afghanistan for more than 50 years on climate change and resilience, gender, governance, health, livelihoods, and the rule of law. Under the broader framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in close coordination with other UN agencies, UNDP supports the Afghan people's aspiration for peace, prosperity, and sustainability. UNDP is currently implementing its flagship crisis response programme, ABADEI (Area Based Approach to Development Emergency Initiatives), as part of the ongoing UN-led response to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and the breakdown of Afghanistan's economy following the August 2021 shift in power and subsequent early recovery and stabilization.\n\nEnergy poverty affects the quality of lives of women and men differently in varying degrees and impacts their health, employment and many basic services. Currently, the demand for energy in the country far exceeds its supply, the transmission and distribution grid are unreliable, and load shedding and outages of electricity supply are common.  Many provinces are not connected to the grid and are therefore largely served through local diesel generating units that increase the costs of supply. Thus, lack of access is linked to affordable energy and impedes economic, social and educational opportunities for the poor and rural residents.\nThe Federal Republic of Germany has made available funds to the project “Sustainable energy services for education and health in Afghanistan (SESEHA)” of UNDP through KfW, Germany’s State-owned Investment and Development Bank.   \n\nThe key objective of the project SESEHA is adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures in public facilities (primarily in health and education sectors) for sustained delivery of essential services for basic human needs in Afghanistan. This proposed project will contribute to better energy access and enables improvements in basic energy supply services in the stated sectors.  \nThe project is aligned with UNDP’s signature solution on Energy and is further conceptualized in the priority area of sustained essential services of the UN’s Strategic Framework for Afghanistan 2023-2025 that directly contributes to the two outcomes: Outcome 1: By the end of 2025, more people in Afghanistan, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalized, including women and girls have their basic human needs progressively met through the sustained delivery of essential services. Outcome 2: By the end of 2025, people in Afghanistan, especially women, youth, and other marginalized groups, and those at risk of being left behind benefit from a more equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient employment-rich economy and shared economic opportunities with enhanced productive capacities for improved livelihoods and decent work.\n",

        "context": "\nThe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste – also commonly known as East Timor – became the world’s first new sovereign state of the 21st century on May 20, 2002. Since independence, the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF, has been active in its efforts to improve the survival, development, protection and participation of children and women in Timor-Leste. \n\nThe vision guiding the Country Programme for UNICEF Timor-Leste, (2021-2025)  is to contribute to national efforts so that all children and adolescents progressively fulfil their basic rights to survival, care, learning, protection and participation to reach their full potential in safe, healthy and green communities. The UNICEF Country Programme marks a critical moment to support Timor-Leste as the country accelerates its efforts to meet the Sustainable Development Goals to significantly reduce poverty, remain a stable and peaceful nation and graduate from the least developed country classification.\nAround 46% of the population of Timor-Leste is under the age of 18, meaning that including youth participation in the development process must be seen as crucial for inclusive and sustainable development. UNICEF’s Communication (external relations) and Communication for Development activities are working to promote youth voices and child participation in the media by engaging them in various initiatives including social media through various programmes.\n\nThis UNV assignment is part of the efforts to raise the profile of children, adolescents and youth, increase participation. The UNV Communication Assistant will also work on covering photography, video and design work for regular programmes. \n\nUN Volunteers should be provided equal duty of care as extended to all host entity personnel.

        "organization_mission": "UNDP is the UN’s global development organisation that supports countries around the world in their efforts to successfully address diverse development challenges, framed around three broad settings which require different forms of support: eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions; accelerating structural transformations for sustainable development; and building resilience to crises and shocks. Strengthening governance systems, promoting rule of law and human rights are cornerstones of UNDP’s work to achieve sustainable human development and eradicate extreme poverty. Within this broad governance mandate, the UNDP Pacific Office is implementing interventions aimed at preventing and fighting corruption and promoting integrity, transparency and accountability guided by SDG 16 (promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive societies) and in line with the planned outcomes of the United Nations Pacific Strategy and the UNDP Sub-Regional Project Document. \n",
        "context": "Pacific Islands countries (PICs) boast “big ocean” economies, with young and mobile populations and highly resilient and adaptative societies. Past and recent investments have however fallen short of developing diverse economies offering inclusive services and opportunities, resilient to external shocks and the increasing pace of climate disasters. While the scale of Pacific economies does not allow them to respond to all these challenges alone, public investment and revenues would gain from empowered officials accountable to keep basic service delivery and development priorities in mind while driving fiscal decisions. \n\nFor this reason, the “Accountable Public Finances to serve Pacific people – Vaka Pasifika” project (hereafter Vaka Pasifika project) builds on the results of the “Strengthening Public Finance Management and Governance in the Pacific” (PFM) project implemented between 2018 and 2022 thanks to the support of the European Union. The proposed overarching goal of this project is to strengthen the governance mechanisms enabling Pacific countries to deliver public services that are better calibrated to meet specific needs of the people. Its specific focus will be to ensure scarce Pacific resources are better managed and the resource base available for achieving national development goals will be increased. To achieve this goal, PIC economies require stable and reliable institutions implementing the right mix of creativity and rigor informed by ground reality. The Project will contribute to this vision by (a) supporting oversight institutions and decision makers to define and implement their priorities through leadership and institutional capacity strengthening and (b) enhancing responsiveness of service delivery and public finance management by developing institutional mechanisms for engagement and openness and strengthening civil society capacity.\n\nThe Vaka Pasifika project is implemented through a team based in Suva, Fiji in the UNDP Pacific Office. As part of the Effective Governance unit, the team is responsible for implementation of the project, its various activities and corresponding institutional processes and requirements. The Vaka Pasifika project focuses on the human and networked resources available to public finance stakeholders in the Pacific, one of the core focuses of the project is to grow a pool of resources working on tailored public finance and accountability tools for the Pacific.\n\nThe Governance for Resilience Project (herein Gov4Res), also implemented by a team based in Suva, Fiji, works with Pacific governments to ensure that countries adapt their decision making and governance systems towards more resilient development. The projects theory of change rests on a core assumption that Pacific Island people will be more resilient to the impacts of climate change and disasters if countries manage all development through a risk informed approach. This is consistent with the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific which calls for the ‘mainstreaming’ of climate and disaster risk treating risk management as fundamental to all development decisions.",
        "living_conditions": "Fiji, one of the larger countries in the South Pacific region, has a relatively high level of human development and is one of the most developed economies in the region. Fiji became independent in 1970. Its multi-ethnic population, which numbers approximately 900,000, is growing slowly due to a moderately low level of fertility and a high level of emigration. The economy rests primarily on sugar production and tourism but is becoming more diverse, with manufacturing now an important sector of employment. The unit of currency is the Fiji dollar. Fiji comprises approximately 330 islands, approximately a third of which are inhabited. Fiji covers about 1.3 million square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean. The two major islands are Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. The capital city is Suva, which is located on the south-eastern side of the main island of Viti Levu. The population is made up of a mixture of native Melanesian and Polynesian islanders and a blend of Indian, European, Chinese, Rotuman, and Rabi islanders, making it a rich and vibrant mix of cultures, sights, sounds, and exotic island delicacies. English is spoken widely on the island, and it is the common language of communication, although the native indigenous Fijian language is spoken by many, as is the Hindi language. Fiji enjoys a mild and stable climate most of the year, due to the large expanses of open water that surround its islands. The wet season extends from November to April, but rainfall occurs throughout the year. Tropical cyclones can blow up between November and April, although they are rarely dangerous. Fiji enjoys year-round tropical temperatures of between 25 and 29 degrees with generally high humidity, making it a perfect location for sun-lovers. Suva, the capital of Fiji, has a population of approximately 141,000 and is a multiracial and multicultural city. Suva is the largest city in the whole of the region, but it remains easy-going and friendly. It has reasonably modern facilities, including two large hospitals, sporting facilities, restaurants, and supermarkets. Modest accommodation is readily available in Suva, but the availability of small apartments is limited. An open mind and flexibility come in handy when looking for housing in Suva. The public transport is quite good: local buses run every day of the week, and taxis are affordable. Public transport is also available for exploring and visiting other parts of the country, which provides plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities and tropical nature.",

        "organization_mission": "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the United Nations' global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. It is on the ground in 177 countries, working on solutions to global and national development challenges. UNDP China assists China in developing its own solutions to the country’s development challenges and works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by reducing poverty, strengthening the rule of law and democratic governance, and by promoting environmental sustainability and South-South Cooperation. ",
        "context": "The International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC), based in Beijing, was jointly initiated and established by the Chinese government, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other international organizations in December 2004. The IPRCC is designed to provide a platform for knowledge sharing, information exchange and international collaboration in the areas of poverty reduction and development. The IPRCC aims at strengthening national and international capacities to design and implement policies and programs for poverty reduction, with a focus on both income and human dimensions of poverty, through (i) providing an effective platform for knowledge sharing and mutual learning on pro-poor policies and anti-poverty programs between China and other developing/transition economies; (ii) supporting a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction through policy-relevant research work and training initiatives covering both macro-policies and targeted programs for poverty reduction; and (iii) promoting dialogue between policymakers, academics and practitioners around pro-poor policy options and strengthening the links between pro-poor policy research, formulation and implementation processes at different levels. IPRCC will also build up its institutional capacity to develop a global poverty reduction and development partnership, through active networking and partnering for knowledge exchange, joint research and training initiatives with poverty reduction focused institutions in China and other countries.\n\nBrief Portfolio Description:\nGlobally, an estimated 131 million people fell back into poverty in 2020 and up to 800 million people are projected to still remain in poverty in 2030 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises – thereby missing the zero poverty goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In line with the UNDP Country Programme Document for China 2021-2025, this project “Building a Global Poverty Reduction and Rural Development Partnership towards Global Poverty Eradication”  aims to support the International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC) in scaling up the dissemination of policies, strategies and practices that were developed by China to achieve its goal of ending extreme rural poverty in the country by 2020 with interested partners. The project will support the IPRCC to bolster its institutional capacity to address global challenges through research, pilot demonstration, international exchanges, and capacity building activities, with a focus on women and other vulnerable groups. By supporting the IPRCC in developing a global poverty reduction and development partnership, the project will enhance the Center’s contribution to global progress on sustainable development, and in particular towards SDG1 (No Poverty) and SDG5 (Gender Equality). \n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",

It has population of over 54 million living across seven States and Seven Re-gions plus Union Territory, where all central government departments are located. On 1 Feb-ruary 2021, following the Myanmar Military took over a state of emergency was declared. Fol-lowing the takeover, the security situation in the country worsened, leading to a “Level 2” emergency designation and in keeping with the relevant protocols triggering the activation of cluster system to respond to the worsening humanitarian situation.  Increased security measures due to the deteriorating security situation, has led to many-fold increase in internally displaced persons (IDP) to more than 1,703,900 from 328,000 before February 2021.\n\nThe country has since experienced a protracted humanitarian situation characterised by sub-optimal access to health services, increasing malnutrition due to deteriorating food security situation and worsening protection risks including risks to mine and other explosive remnants of war injuries. Apart from this, education services access has deteriorated, and the COVID-19 pandemic induced restrictions led to an almost continuous nationwide school closure from March 2020. The closures left over 12 million school aged children in Myanmar with limited access to materials for their learning and overall well-being, including education, mental health and psycho-social support and Covid-19 prevention materials. Following the military takeover in February 2021 the humanitarian crisis further worsened, and other dynamics such as an increasingly difficult economic situation continue, high inflation leading to reduced purchasing power of the local currency and access to markets. Generally, this disproportionately affected children and other vulnerable persons’ access to health, nutritious foods, protection, and education services. In this context, the humanitarian wide support needs to be strengthened and this includes information management functions to monitor the situation, evaluate response progress as per the humanitarian response plans targets and activities, promote advocacy and evidence-based program response.  Therefore, the need to hire a nutrition information management officer who will be an integral part of the Nutrition Cluster functions.\n\n",

ESCAP emphasizes strengthening institutional capacities to serve the rights of the people of the region and address their aspirations and needs. ESCAP pursues this objective by carrying out work, in close cooperation with other United Nations entities and intergovernmental organizations in the region, in multiple areas, including Statistics.\nCivil registration is the critical act of recording important events in people’s lives such as births, marriages, divorces, adoptions, deaths, and causes of death. It provides individuals with the official recognition and documentation necessary to establish legal identity, family relationships and civil status. This documentation is essential for individuals to exercise various human, legal, economic, social and political rights and enables access to services, such as health, education and social protection.\nVital statistics generated from civil registration significantly contribute to the formulation of effective and efficient evidence-based policy across multiple sectors. Reliable information on births, fertility and deaths enable the production of timely and accurate population estimates and other demographic and health statistics, which contribute to more effective planning, efficient resource allocation and accurate evaluation and monitoring, such as of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAssignment context:\n\nThis UNV assignment is part of ESCAP’s programme on Statistics and will be placed in the team supporting the regional initiative to Get Every One in the Picture. Website: http://www.getinthepicture.org. ESCAP is working with governments and development partners to improve civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) in the region as part of the implementation of the Asia Pacific CRVS Decade (2015-2024) launched in 2014. \n",
        "living_conditions": "Thailand is located in Southeast Asia. The climate is tropical, with the monsoon season running from May/June through October/November. Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, and it is also the most populated city in the country. It is located in the Chao Phraya River delta in the central part of the country. Bangkok has an estimated population of 8.75 million as of 2017 (13% of Thailand’s total population), based on data from the 2010 census. Over the past decades, Bangkok has grown rapidly with little urban planning or regulation. This has led to traffic congestion and air pollution, and there is frequent flooding of streets during the rainy season in the City’s low-lying areas. \nThe cost of living in Thailand is relatively low, as compared to many other capitals in Southeast Asia. Housing is widely available in various sizes and at various price points. Private healthcare in Thailand is of excellent standard, and there are numerous top hospitals in Bangkok, which fall far below countries like the US in terms of price. There are numerous high-quality international schools available in Bangkok, with English as the language of instruction. Bangkok has different public transportation options, including the BTS Skytrain and MRT Underground, metered taxis, mobile-based ride-hailing services (Grab, All Thai Taxi, etc.), tuk tuks, motorbike taxis, buses and boats. \n",

UNAMA was established by the UN Security Council Resolution 1401 in March 2002 at the request of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Its mandate is reviewed annually with the latest mandate renewal being on 17 September 2019 when the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2489 Resolution 2489 (2019) calls for UNAMA and the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, within their mandate and in a manner consistent with Afghan sovereignty, leadership and ownership, to continue to lead and coordinate international civilian efforts in full cooperation with the Government of Afghanistan. UNAMA maintains a permanent and extensive field presence across Afghanistan, as well as liaison offices in Pakistan and Iran. The Mission has more than 1, 211 staff - comprised of 833 Afghan nationals, 310 international staff and 68 UNVs. (Figures from December 2018.)",
        "living_conditions": "Afghanistan is a hardship duty station with a volatile security. Living and working  conditions for UN volunteers in UNAMA are similar to the living conditions of all other internationally recruited staff members. UN volunteers are provided with safe accommodation in an extensive compound in Kabul with good infrastructure and amenities. The mission has three compounds in Kabul: Compound Alpha, and UNOCA (UN Operational Complex in Afghanistan) the largest one. UNAMA has three different locations in Kabul, most of the substantive offices, including the SRSG’s are located at the so-called alpha Compound and Palace #7, which is close to the city center, while most of the administrative and technical support offices are located at the UNOCA compound on Jalalabad Road, at some distance from central Kabul. Generally speaking stringent security measures are in place throughout the country and UN volunteers as other UN staff, are quite limited to duty stations when it comes to movement. Walking is virtually not allowed. The movement is done inside the “green zone” (only) in armored vehicles driven by national qualified UN drivers. The single unit accommodation in UNOCA and other field locations are fully furnished; this includes, furniture, washing machine dryer, hot plate, iron and iron stand, microwave, plates, cups, spoons, cooking utensils, electric kettle. One bedsheet and pillow cover is provided. The monthly charge for UN provided accommodation is USD 300 which is deducted from the monthly Volunteer Living Allowance. Inside the UNOCA compound are two cafeterias, a restaurant, a Supermarket and 3 small shops which provide a variety of imported canned and frozen food on offer. There is a Fresh vegetable market daily. There is also a social center, a gym hall and a small library with books and DVDs, run by the welfare Office, within the same compound. UNOCA has a new minimarket where basic goods can be bought also. There are also a number of UN cleared supermarkets in Kabul, in Jalalabad, and in Mazar-I-Sharif. The Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own towel and other personal accessories including toiletries and medicines which they may not find easily within the super markets inside the UNOCA Compound. Some degree of medical service is provided in all UNAMA duty stations. There is a UN clinic in UNAMA/UNOCA complex and access is granted in Kabul to other private international clinics (when and if needed). Contact with and outreach to the local community is usually limited. As mentioned, many places are off-limits and the choice of recreational facilities are very poor. For all these reasons, bring a stock of books, DVDs/VCDs, computer games, etc., is highly recommended. Summer in Afghanistan is hot and dry but winter is the opposite – cold and wet. Therefore, both summer and winter clothing and comfortable boots with insulation are necessary. Afghanistan is a unique country and UNAMA is a unique UN mission. It requires more stamina, commitment, and\nflexibility than elsewhere to make life comfortable. Therefore, flexibility and the ability and willingness to live and work in hazardous and harsh conditions involving physical hardship and little comfort is essential.\n",

        "living_conditions": "Afghanistan is a hardship duty station with a volatile security. Living and working conditions for UN volunteers in UNAMA are similar to the living conditions of all other internationally recruited staff members. UN volunteers are provided with safe accommodation in an extensive compound in Kabul with good infrastructure and amenities. The mission has three compounds in Kabul: Compound Alpha, and UNOCA (UN Operational Complex in Afghanistan) the largest one.\n\nUNAMA has three different locations in Kabul, most of the substantive offices, including the SRSG’s are located at the so-called alpha Compound and Palace #7, which is close to the city center, while most of the administrative and technical support offices are located at the UNOCA compound on Jalalabad Road, at some distance from central Kabul.\n\nGenerally speaking, stringent security measures are in place throughout the country and UN volunteers as other UN staff, are quite limited to duty stations when it comes to movement. Walking is virtually not allowed. The movement is done inside the “green zone” (only) in armored vehicles driven by national qualified UN drivers. \n\nThe single unit accommodation in UNOCA and other field locations are fully furnished; this includes, furniture, washing machine dryer, hot plate, iron and iron stand, microwave, plates, cups, spoons, cooking utensils, electric kettle. One bedsheet and pillow cover is provided. The monthly charge for UN provided accommodation is USD 300 which is deducted from the monthly Volunteer Living Allowance. \n\nInside the UNOCA compound are two cafeterias, a restaurant, a Supermarket and 3 small shops which provide a variety of imported canned and frozen food on offer. There is a Fresh vegetable market daily. There is also a social center, a gym hall and a small library with books and DVDs, run by the welfare Office, within the same compound. UNOCA has a new minimarket where basic goods can be bought also. There are also a number of UN cleared supermarkets in Kabul, in Jalalabad, and in Mazar-I-Sharif. The Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own towel and other personal accessories including toiletries and medicines which they may not find easily within the supermarkets inside the UNOCA Compound.\n\nSome degree of medical service is provided in all UNAMA duty stations. There is a UN clinic in UNAMA/UNOCA complex, and access is granted in Kabul to other private international clinics (when and if needed).\n\nContact with and outreach to the local community is usually limited. As mentioned, many places are off-limits, and the choice of recreational facilities are very poor. For all these reasons, bring a stock of books, DVDs/VCDs, computer games, etc., is highly recommended.\n\nSummer in Afghanistan is hot and dry, but winter is the opposite – cold and wet. Therefore, both summer and winter clothing and comfortable boots with insulation are necessary. \n\nAfghanistan is a unique country and UNAMA is a unique UN mission. It requires more stamina, commitment, and flexibility than elsewhere to make life comfortable. Therefore, flexibility and the ability and willingness to live and work in hazardous and harsh conditions involving physical hardship and little comfort is essential\n",

        "organization_mission": "UNDP's mandate is to end poverty, build democratic governance, rule of law, and inclusive institutions. We advocate for change, and connect countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life.\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has partnered with Bangladesh ever since its birth and through its remarkable journey from a war-ravaged economy to a middle-income country. It remains a catalyst in Bangladesh’s journey from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. UNDP assists in building institutions and helps strengthen institutional capacities through people-centric, pro-poor, inclusive and sustainable policy making and development governance.",
        "context": "UNDP supports stabilization, state-building, governance and development priorities in partnership with Bangladesh governments, the United Nations system, the development partners and other partners to help the country to achieve sustainable development by eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, accelerating structural transformations for sustainable development and building resilience to crises and shock. Bangladesh is already poised to graduate out of Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2026. But achieving the goal of becoming a developed nation depends on successfully navigating the LDC graduation impacts, attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), fulfilling the commitment to Leave No One Behind (LNOB) by 2030, and achieving Upper Middle-Income Country (UMIC) status by 2031. These key steps are constrained by several challenges including inequality, inadequate employment opportunities, underutilized youth population, low domestic resource mobilization and private investment, and risks due to climate change, among others.  \n\nThe challenges of achieving Bangladesh’s mid-term goals and implementing the 8FYP amidst economic uncertainties will require rapid need-based analysis of diverse issues. Preparing the country for smooth graduation from the LDC status also requires short and rapid appraisals of programmes and policies. An arrangement for rapid policy-oriented research support to cater to the needs of some key government departments could be crucial for post-Covid-19 policymaking for economic recovery. \n\nGiven the contexts mentioned above, UNDP is in the process to set up an Economic Policy Unit (EPU) that will involve researchers and experts on various timely economic analysis. The research initiatives will require supports from junior researchers on data generation, compilation and analysis. Therefore, the EPU needs a Research Assistant for data analyses, literature searches and other relevant tasks as assigned.\n\n\nCurrent Project Background (Bangladesh): On an average, every day the 26 public hospitals of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh produce more than 3,120 Kg/day of waste. And there is no systematic way to properly manage infectious waste that is manually disposed of or treated inside or outside the hospital areas. The hospitals as well as municipalities are also not well equipped with modern machinery in treating the infectious wastes that are generated from the hospitals separately. However, the project mainly aims to strengthen the infectious healthcare waste management systems by deploying locally appropriate healthcare waste management practices and technologies to help address both infectious and non-infectious healthcare challenges during and beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic to protect human health and help minimize the Pandemic's environmental and social impacts. The current Project covers all district level (3) and sub-district (23) level public hospitals in Chittagong Hill Tracts (a total of 26 hospitals) under the following three main outputs:\n\n1.  Use of modern technology (autoclaves/ Microwaves for Infectious Healthcare Waste Management.\n2.  Capacity Building of the hospital staff on healthcare waste management.\n3.  Development of local guidelines based on national and international guidelines\n\n",

        "living_conditions": "Papua New Guinea (PNG) occupies the eastern part of the Island of New Guinea – the world's second largest island – and its offshore islands in Melanesia. It is unique in many respects: linguistically, it is the world's most diverse country, with more than 700 native tongues. \n\nPNG provides an interesting and enriching environment, but also requires a mature level of cultural awareness, as well as a relatively high level of stamina and commitment to make life comfortable and affordable.\n\nPort Moresby is the capital of PNG and is the largest city in the Pacific Islands outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the south-eastern coast of the Papuan peninsula on the shores of the Gulf of Papua. The city’s official population according to the PNG National Statistical Office is 364,125, but it is believed to be double that figure. The expansion of the PNG economy – thanks to a thriving extractive industry – became the trigger for the growth of Port Moresby.\n\nSuccessive national governments and municipal authorities rolled out modern facilities, complimenting increased investment in property development by the private sector. Today Port Moresby’s skyline has evolved from low-set buildings to multi-storeyed apartment blocks.\n\nSecurity Advisory: UN travellers to/in Papua New Guinea and Bougainville are advised to exercise a high degree of caution. Crime rates are high, particularly in the capital and in the large cities. Violent carjacking, street robberies, house breaking, violence against women and sexual assaults frequently occur. All travel at night must be made by vehicle. Tribal conflicts, riots and looting are frequent in the Highlands provinces. Agencies undertaking visits to the highlands must take special security arrangements including protection team in certain areas. Security arrangements have to be detailed when submitting the clearance.\n\nHealth and medical services. Malaria is endemic in all areas. Dengue fever is also common in coastal towns, including Port Moresby. Tuberculosis is common. HIV/AIDS and other STDs are also present. PNG only offers basic medical facilities and you should ensure you discuss all possible vaccinations and other preventative measures recommended for Papua New Guinea with your primary care physician prior to leaving your home country.\n\nSocial issues: Despite Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) economic boom led by extractive industries, almost 40 percent of the country’s population lives in poverty. Gender inequality, violence, corruption at all levels, excessive use of force by Police and domestic violence continue to affect PNG citizens. Rates of family and sexual violence are among the highest in the world. Road and traffic\nconditions are poor; as such accidents are likely, with only limited emergency response services available.\n\nAccommodation: The accommodation rates in PNG is incomparable with most other cities in the world as it is very costly.\n\nGroceries: There are a number of supermarkets and grocery shops stocking a diverse range of products but mainly influenced by the city’s trade with East Asian countries, America, India, Australia and New Zealand. They also have provision for people with special dietary requirements.\n\nVisas: All foreign visitors to PNG require a visa to enter. They will not be issued at the airport. Transit visas always are required for transit through Australia, even if remaining in the international transit area for a few hours.\n\nCurrency: PNG’s currency is the Kina.\n  \nElectricity: The electricity current in PNG is 240V AC 50Hz using Australian-style plugs.\n",

With a focus on moving from awareness to action, empowering young people with the knowledge, skills and networks to address sustainability issues, YELL has two objectives: \n(1)\tTo address the knowledge and resource gaps among local youth from diverse background by localising climate narratives through inclusion and emphasis on local and indigenous perspectives on nature and the environment, and \n(2)\tTo strengthen the ecosystem of actors to support and hold the space for youth to engage as agents of change in environmental policy- and decision-making and in environmental actions.\nYELL’s objectives will be achieved through three programmatic pillars: the ‘Exploraction’ programme, the ‘Conservocation’ programme, and the YELL Network Resource Hub. YELL is expected to enable children and young people aged 7-30 years old to act on climate and environmental issues with structured entry points through the three programmatic pillars.\nIn 2023, YELL is implementing a work placement pilot under one of its programmes - called Conservocation - that aims to encourage young people from different backgrounds an opportunity to embark on a viable green career, regardless of their educational level or background through a UN Community Volunteer exposure experience at a network partner organisation. \nThe objectives of the work placement exposure are:  \n\n1.\tTo provide a platform for young people to be exposed to and experience work in the environmental sector impacting their own community or of other communities, building an understanding of intersectionalities (human rights, social, economy) and the environment.\n2.\tTo build a network in the sector for future references and collaborations. \n3.\tTo widen young people’s perspectives about careers in sustainability and conservation, to help them assess their own interests and abilities. \n4.\tTo provide an opportunity for skills building that is relevant to the sector.\n\nSoutheast Asia Disaster Prevention Research Initiative (SEADPRI-UKM)(https://www.ukm.my/seadpri/)\nSoutheast Asia Disaster Prevention Research Initiative (SEADPRI-UKM) comes under the administrative structure of the Institute of Environment and Development (LESTARI) at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

        "context": "UNDP’s role is to help fortify development outcomes among local communities, government partners, and the private sector, using the SDGs as both a destination and a guide. Through the SDGs, a transformative shift from a war economy to a peace economy is possible, helping Afghanistan to meet its global commitments, its internal targets (such as those set by the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework-ANPDF), and, most importantly, the expectations and ambitions of the Afghan people. While this bold vision demands investments from UNDP, among all development actors, UNDP Afghanistan Country Office is providing insights on understanding and overcoming multidimensional poverty. UNDP’s perspective is that meaningful poverty alleviation requires a different development approach – one that monitors and attempts to affect the systemic interplay of socioeconomic factors, regional differences, and shifts in the political economy. To deliver this value proposition, the CO needs to ‘raise the bar’ on its development policy expertise and engage national and local policy makers on disrupting the complex systems contributing to intractable poverty.\n\nThis UNV assignment is part of a new office structure with UNDP Afghanistan, which is designed to support a more integrated and collaborative way in supporting Afghanistan achieve sustainable development and sustainable peace. The Country Office has aligned the new office structure with the thematic vision of the emerging Country Programme and designed new ways of working that will facilitate more collaboration across the office, create the foundations for more sub-national level work and higher delivery and emphasize learning and support to national staff capacity development.\t \n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does - in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, trans-lates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life - in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. \n\nThere is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",
        "context": "UNICEF Bangladesh has scaled up its programming considerably in response to the 2018 Rohingya crisis and more recently the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, with commensurate increases in funding needs. The capacity of the office to raise and manage these additional funds, as well as ensure adequate funding for the existing and upcoming new country programme, has been strengthened by the setting up of a resource mobilization and partnerships team reporting to the Deputy Representative.\n\nThis team has contributed to diversifying significantly the overall public and private donor portfolio, successfully increasing annual revenue from an average of approximately $60m per year over the course of the last CPD until 2017 to over $150m in 2020. The need for ongoing technical support and sustained attention to contribution management will be extended well into future years. Continued and timely donor reporting will be critical to maintaining both the humanitarian response as well as delivering the large-scale ongoing development programme.\n\nWorking as a key member of the resource mobilization and partnerships team, this role is based in Dhaka and will collaborate closely with the programme sections and the Cox’s Bazar PMR team; and ensure funding needs - in particular for the regular programme - are supported, whilst safeguarding overall quality in fundraising activities, systems and processes.\n\nContinued resource mobilization and timely donor support is critical to enable UNICEF to deliver at scale. For this reason, donor intelligence and research is crucial to ensure that donors are approached strategically, and that proposals, reports and other programmatic documents are delivered at a high standard, in line with organizational standards and bench-marks, and aligned with donor expectations.\n\n\nPurpose for the job:\n\nUnder the general guidance and supervision of Donor Relations Specialist (P3), the UNV Research and Business Intelligence will support the overall effort of the unit to build partnerships and mobilize appropriate and sustainable resource base for programs.\n\nThe UNV Research and Business Intelligence will support the implementation of the existing resource mobilization strategy, gathering donor intelligence, development and maintenance of information systems, including tracking of the funding pipeline, trends and gaps, development of new tools and procedures, and development of UNICEF’s strategic partnerships with bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors as well as the private sector.\n",

        "organization_mission": "The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.",

        "living_conditions": "Cox's Bazar is a district of Bangladesh, and it is famous for fishing port and tourism. It is one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Bangladesh. The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 120 km (75 miles) sandy sea beach with a gentle slope, making it the second longest sea beach in the world. The climate of Cox's bazar is similar to the rest of the country. The climate of Bangladesh is generally determined by its location in the tropical monsoon region: high temperature, heavy rainfall, generally excessive humidity, and distinct seasonal variations. It is further characterized by the location in the coastal area. Historically Cox’s Bazar, like other parts of Bangladesh, is a safe place to live. Since August 2017, with the large scale Rohingya influx from Myanmar, Cox’s Bazar is seen as a district with a humanitarian crisis. Culturally Cox’s Bazar is very diverse and well known for its traditional heritage. The communications systems in Cox’s Bazar are well developed and the district is well-connected with other cities. All the national mobile networks are operational in Cox’s Bazar. Walking within Cox’s Bazar city is only allowed during daytime. Travel by rickshaw is also permitted within Cox’s Bazar only during daytime. Cox’s Bazar has a domestic airport and is currently classified as a family duty station (Security Level 3-moderate; Hardship category-D).",

Implementation of governance reform such as the Public Administration Reform, Public Financial Management Reform and Sub-national Democratic Development Reform delivered significant gains. Regardless of the achievements, further progress can be made to ensure responsiveness of public institutions to the rights of people, compliance with the highest standards of transparency, and participation of women, men including the marginalized in public affairs and democratic decision-making. Governance is the lynchpin to achieving the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, it is critical to accelerate attaining the Cambodian Sustainable Development Goals (CSDGs).\n\nIn this context, UNDP Cambodia implements two projects promoting accountability and participation in line with a UNDP Country Programme outcome. \n\n1)\tThe Building Capacities for Civic Engagement, Peacebuilding and Inclusive Dialogue: Towards Inclusive and Participatory Governance (Civic Engagement project)  \n\nThe civic engagement project is organised around three pillars 1) Capacity development of CSOs and government institutions 2) Improving quality in engagement modalities 3) increase exposure and opportunities in which citizens, CSOs and government institutions work together. The target provinces of the Civic Engagement project are Kampong Cham, Kampot, Ratanakiri and Siem Reap. The overall objective of the Civic Engagement project is to pro-mote democratic governance initiatives and a peaceful, inclusive, and equitable society through expanding opportunities for inclusive civic engagement using dialogue in Cambodia. Through partnerships with national and sub-national government and civil society organisations, the project promotes the cultivation of more collaborative mindsets and partnerships between civil society and civil servants. \n\n2)\tProject for Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Local Governance through Civic Engagement (STA project). \n\nThe STA project is organised around two pillars 1) Improved people’s access to info and analytical and critical thinking 2) Sub-National Administrations accountability to people is strengthened. Target provinces include Kampong Cham (Kampong Cham), Ratanakiri (Banlung) and Siem Reap (Siem Reap). The STA project aims to contribute to the National Programme on Sub-National Democratic Development Phase 2. Through civil society, municipal and national government partners, the STA project, intends to make local governance information such as public services, local plans, budget allocations and sub-national administration performance more accessible to people along with supporting people’s monitoring capaci-ties of sub-national administrations performance.\n\nThe international UN Youth Volunteer will perform M&E, reporting and communication functions for these two projects and other governance related intervention.\n",

Khmer is the official language and the main religion in Cambodia is Buddhism. The Riel is the official currency, however, both US Dollars and Riel are widely used and in cities there is good access to banking and ATMs. The cost of living in Cambodia is relatively low, as compared to many other capitals in Southeast Asia.\n\nHouse hunting is not difficult in Phnom Penh. Housing is widely available in various sizes and at various price points and Wi-Fi coverage is some of the best in Southeast Asia. Houses and apartments are available to suit most budgets and preferences. The usual means of locating suitable accommodation is through estate agents/realtors. International UN Volunteers are required to follow the UN residential security requirements as per the local MORSS when choosing their accommodation. Food and shopping centers are readily accessible. \n\n\nThere are few taxi operators in Phnom Penh, so for daily transportation the cheapest, fastest and most frequent mode of travel is by a tuk-tuk (a motor-powered rickshaw). Some UN volunteers chose to purchase their own mode of transportation, be it a car, a motorbike or a pushbike. They are strictly recommended by UN security to wear seatbelts in cars and helmets when traveling on motorbikes, tuk-tuk or bicycling. \n\nIn terms of health, common diseases in Cambodia are those which exist in other tropical countries like diarrhoea, malaria, dengue and HIV/AIDS. Most of the serious cases have been reported contracted in hilly, rural and densely forested areas. City dwellers like in Phnom Penh can also be at risk due to poor disposal of waste. Generally in cities, people use purified water for drinking and cooking. The recommended vaccinations are those against typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Tuberculosis and Japanese Encephalitis. \n\nWhile medical facilities in Cambodia are sufficient for the treatment of most routine ailments and minor accidents, illnesses and accidents of more serious nature require medical evacuation, usually to Bangkok or Singapore.
